# GraphML-Based Exchange Format for Violation Witnesses and Correctness Witnesses

### Basics

We formally represent witnesses as witness automata. Since an automaton is a graph, we decided to extend an existing exchange format (GraphML) for graphs and apply it to witness automata. [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) is an XML-based format for exchanging graphs that was designed with extensibility in mind. (This [primer](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/primer/graphml-primer.html) gives a good introduction.)

The idea is that a violation-witness automaton guides the verifier for a finite number of steps through the program along an error path in order to find a violation of the safety property,
and that a correctness-witness automaton gives invariants as hints that guide the verifier towards the proof.

Note that a violation-witness automaton might represent several possible paths. In particular, the automaton might represent several infeasible error paths and feasible error paths. Ideally, the error path is very short and contains concrete values (test case).

### Data Elements

In order to represent the witness automaton in GraphML, the edges and nodes of the graph are enriched with (XML) ``data`` elements of different types. The ``key`` attribute of a data element defines its type, the child elements of the element (usually a single XML text node) represent its value.

#### Graph Data for Witness Automata

These annotations are used for the ``graph`` GraphML tag,
i.e. for ``data`` tags that are direct children of the ``graph`` tag.

| key | Meaning | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| witness-format-version | *Valid values*: ``1.0``. When missing, the format version ``1.0`` is assumed | No |
| witness-type | *Valid values:* ``correctness_witness`` or ``violation_witness`` <br /> ``witness-type`` is used to specify the witness type. A correctness witness is identified by the value ``correctness_witness``, a violation witness is identified by the value ``violation_witness``. | Yes |
| sourcecodelang | *Valid values:* Currently, only ``C`` and ``Java`` are supported. <br /> ``sourcecodelang`` is used to specify the name of the programming language, for example ``C``. | Yes |
| producer | *Valid values:* Any <br /> ``producer`` is used to specify the name of the tool that produced the witness automaton, for example ``CPAchecker 1.6.8`` | Yes |
| specification | *Valid values:* The specification text <br /> ``specification`` is used to provide a textual representation of the specification of the verification task. The format of this representation is user defined. In SV-COMP, the text ``CHECK( init(main()), LTL(G ! call(reach_error())) )`` is used to represent the specification. | Yes |
| programfile | *Valid values:* The program file path as passed to the verifier <br /> ``programfile`` is used to record the URI or file-system path to the source code, e.g., ``loop-acceleration/multivar_true-unreach-call1_true-termination.i``. This key is intended for documentation purposes; a validator is not required to be able to access the specified file location, because the source code is explicitly provided to the validator as input. Hence, the validity of the witness must not depend on the availability of the source code at the location specified by the value of this key in the execution environment of the validation. | Yes |
| programhash | *Valid values:* SHA-256 hash <br /> ``programhash`` is used to record the SHA-256 hash value of the verified program, for example, ``e2d5365a863c1c57fbe2870942676040efc3aea2d9bb085092800d6e256daf06``. | Yes |
| architecture | *Valid values:* An identifier for the assumed architecture <br /> ``architecture`` is used to provide a textual representation of the machine architecture assumed for the verification task. This textual representation is user defined. For example, use the identifiers ``32bit`` and ``64bit`` to distinguish between 32-bit systems and 64-bit systems. | Yes |
| creationtime | *Valid values:* Date and time of creation in ISO 8601 format. <br /> ``creationtime`` is used to specify the date and time the witness was created in ISO 8601 format. The date must contain the year, the month, and the day, separated by dashes ('-'). The date is separated from the time using the capital letter 'T'. The time must be given in hours, minutes, and seconds, separated by colons (':'). If the timestamp is in UTC time, it ends with a 'Z'. If the timestamp is not given in UTC time, a positive ('+') or negative ('-') time offset consisting of hours and minutes separated by a colon (':') must be appended. Example: ``2016-12-24T13:15:32+02:00``. | Yes |

#### Node Data for Automata States

These annotations are used for the ``node`` GraphML tags,
i.e. for ``data`` tags that are direct children of the ``node`` tags.
In witness automata, the GraphML nodes represent states.

| key | Meaning | Allowed in Violation Witnesses | Allowed in Correctness Witnesses |
| --- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| entry | *Valid values:* ``false`` (default) or ``true`` <br /> ``entry`` is used to mark a ``node`` as an entry node. An entry node represents the initial control state of the witness automaton. We require that exactly one initial control state is defined per document. The ``attr.type`` attribute of this key is ``boolean``. If no default value is specified in the GraphML header, the default value is ``false``. | Yes | Yes |
| sink | *Valid values:* ``false`` (default) or ``true`` <br /> ``sink`` is used to mark a ``node`` as a sink node. A sink node represents a sink control state in the automaton. Sink states are not allowed in correctness-witness automata. The ``attr.type`` attribute of this key is ``boolean``. If no default value is specified in the GraphML header, the default value is ``false``. | Yes | No |
| violation | *Valid values:* ``false`` (default) or ``true`` <br /> ``violation`` is used to mark a control state as a violation state, i.e., as a state that represents a specification violation. Violation control states are not allowed in the syntax for correctness witnesses, because all control states are implicitly accepting states. The ``attr.type`` attribute of this key is ``boolean``. If no default value is specified in the GraphML header, the default value is ``false``.| Yes | No |
| invariant | *Valid values:* A C expression that (1) must evaluate to the C type ``int`` (used as boolean) and (2) **may** consist of conjunctions or disjunctions, but not function calls. <br /> ``invariant`` is used to specify an invariant for a control state. The value of a ``data`` element with this key must be an expression that evaluates to a value of the equivalent of a boolean type in the programming language of the verification task, e.g., for C programs a C expression that evaluates to a value of the C type ``int`` (used as boolean). The expression may consist of conjunctions or disjunctions, but not function calls. Local variables that have the same name as global variables or local variables of other functions can be qualified by using a ``data`` element with the ``invariant.scope`` key. The ``attr.type`` attribute of this key is ``string``. All variables used in the expression must appear in the program source code. If a control state does not have a ``data`` element with this key, a consumer shall consider the state invariant to be ``true``. | No | Yes |
| invariant.scope | *Valid values:* Function name <br /> ``invariant.scope`` is used to qualify variables with ambiguous names in a state invariant by specifying a function name: The witness consumer must map the variables in the given invariant to the variables in the source code. Due to scopes in many programming languages, such as C, there may be ambiguously named variables in different scopes. The consumer first has to look for a variable with a matching name in the scope of the function with the name specified via a ``data`` element with the ``invariant.scope`` key before checking the global scope. This key always applies to the invariant as a whole, i.e., it is not possible to specify an invariant over local variables of different functions. In existing implementations, there is currently no support for different variables with the same name within different scopes of the same function. The ``attr.type`` attribute of this key is ``string``. | No | Yes |

#### Edge Data for Automata Transitions

These annotations are used for the ``edge`` GraphML tags,
i.e. for ``data`` tags that are direct children of the ``edge`` tags.
In witness automata, the GraphML edges represent state transitions.

| key | Meaning | Allowed in Violation Witnesses | Allowed in Correctness Witnesses |
| --- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| assumption | *Valid values:* Expression that (1) evaluates to a value of the equivalent of a Boolean type in the programming language of the verification task and (2) **may** consist of conjunctions or disjunctions, but not function calls <br /> ``assumption`` is used to specify a state-space guard for a transition. The value of a ``data`` element with this key must be an expression that evaluates to a value of the equivalent of a boolean type in the programming language of the verification task, e.g. for C programs a C expression that evaluates to a value of the C type ``int`` (used as boolean). The expression may consist of conjunctions or disjunctions, but not function calls. Local variables that have the same name as global variables or local variables of other functions can be qualified by using a ``data`` element with the ``assumption.scope`` key. All variables used in the expression must appear in the program source code, except for the variable ``\result``, which represents the return value of a function identified by the ``data`` element with the key ``assumption.resultfunction`` after a function-return operation on a CFA edge matched by this transition. If the ``\result`` variable is used, the name of the corresponding function must be provided using a ``data`` element with the ``assumption.resultfunction`` key. If a transition does not have a ``data`` element with this key, a consumer shall assume that the state-space guard of this transition is ``true``. In correctness witnesses, for each state and each source-code guard, the disjunction of all state-space guards leaving that state via a transition matched by that source-code guard must be ``true``, i.e., while state-space guards can be used to split the state space in correctness witnesses, they may not be used to restrict it. The ``attr.type`` attribute of this key is ``string``. | Yes | Yes
| assumption.scope | *Valid values:* Function name <br /> ``assumption.scope`` is used to qualify variables with ambiguous names in a state-space guard by specifying a function name: The consumer first has to look for a variable with a matching name in the scope of the function with the name specified via a ``data`` element with the ``assumption.scope`` key before checking the global scope. This key always applies to the state-space guard as a whole, i.e., it is not possible to specify a state-space guard over local variables of different functions. In existing implementations, there is currently no support for different variables with the same name within different scopes of the same function. This key is not allowed in correctness witnesses. The ``attr.type`` attribute of this key is ``string.`` | Yes | Yes |
| assumption.resultfunction | *Valid values:* Function name <br /> ``assumption.resultfunction`` is used to specify the function of the ``\result`` variable used in a state-space guard of the same transition, meaning that ``\result`` represents the return value of the given function. This key applies to the state-space guard as a whole, it is therefore not possible to refer to multiple function-return values within the same transition. If the ``\result`` variable is used, a ``data`` element with this key must be used in the same transition, otherwise it is superfluous. This key is not allowed in correctness witnesses. The ``attr.type`` attribute of this key is ``string``. | Yes | Yes |
| control | *Valid values:* ``condition-true`` or ``condition-false`` <br /> ``control`` is used as part of the source-code guard of a transition and restricts the set of CFA edges matched by the source-code guard to assume operations of the CFA. Valid values for ``data`` elements with this key are ``condition-true`` and ``condition-false``, where ``condition-true`` specifies the branch where the assume condition evaluates to ``true``, i.e., the ``then`` branch, and ``condition-false`` specifies the branch where the assume condition evaluates to ``false``, i.e., the ``else`` branch. The ``attr.type`` attribute of this key is ``string``. | Yes | Yes |
| startline | *Valid values:* Valid line number of the program <br /> ``startline`` is used as part of the source-code guard of a transition and restricts the set of CFA edges matched by the source-code guard to operations on specific lines in the source code. Any line number of the source code is a valid value for ``data`` elements with this key. A ``startline`` refers to the line number on which an operation of a CFA edge begins. The ``attr.type`` attribute of this key is ``int``. | Yes | Yes |
| endline | *Valid values:* Valid line number of the program <br /> ``endline`` is the same as the ``startline`` key, except that it refers to the line number on which an operation of a CFA edge ends. | Yes | Yes |
| startoffset | *Valid values:* Offset of a specific character in the program from the program start. <br /> ``startoffset`` is used as part of the source-code guard of a transition and restricts the set of CFA edges matched by the source-code guard to operations between specific character offsets in the source code, where the term character offset refers to the total number of characters from the beginning of a source-code file up to the beginning of some intended statement or expression. Any character offset between the beginning and end of a source-code file is a valid value for ``data`` elements with this key. While on the one hand, usage of ``data`` elements with this key allows the witness to convey very precise location information, on the other hand, this information is susceptible to even minor changes in the source code. If this is not desired, usage of ``data`` elements with this key should be omitted by the producer, or, if that is not an option, it can be removed during a post-processing step, provided that enough other source-code guards are present to make matching the witness against the source code feasible. A third option would be to recompute the offset values for the changed source code using a diff tool. The ``attr.type`` attribute of this key is ``int``. | Yes | Yes |
| endoffset | *Valid values:* Offset of a specific character in the program from the program start. <br /> ``endoffset`` is the same as the ``startoffset`` key, except that it refers to the character offset at the end of an operation. | Yes | Yes |
| enterLoopHead | *Valid values:* ``false`` (default) or ``true`` <br /> ``enterLoopHead`` is used as part of the source-code guard of a transition and restricts the set of CFA edges matched by the source-code guard to operations on CFA edges where the successor is a loop head. For our format specification, any CFA node that (1) is part of a loop in the CFA, (2) has an entering CFA edge where the predecessor node is not in the loop, and (3) has a leaving CFA edge where the successor node is not in the loop, qualifies as a loop head. Note, however, that depending on the programming language of the verification task, the loop head may be ambiguous. For example, in C it is possible to use ``goto`` statements to construct arbitrarily complex loops with many CFA nodes that match the definition above. Conversely, there could also be loops without any loop head matching this definition, in which case the key may not be used. The ``attr.type`` attribute of this key is ``boolean`` and its default value is ``false`` if no other default value is specified in the GraphML header. | Yes | Yes |
| enterFunction | *Valid values:* Function name <br /> ``enterFunction`` is used as part of the source-code guard of a transition and restricts the set of CFA edges matched by the source-code guard to function-call operations where the name of the called function matches the specified value. The ``attr.type`` attribute of this key is ``string``. A witness consumer may also use this key to track a stack of function calls and use this information to qualify ambiguously named variables in state-space guards or state invariants in the absence of explicitly specified scopes via the ``assumption.scope`` or ``invariant.scope`` keys. The ``attr.type`` attribute of this key is ``string``. | Yes | Yes |
| returnFromFunction | *Valid values:* Function name <br /> ``returnFromFunction`` is the counterpart of the ``enterFunction`` key, i.e., it is used as part of the source-code guard of a transition and restricts the set of CFA edges matched by the source-code guard to function-return operations where the name of the function that is being returned from matches the specified value. Analogously to ``enterFunction``, a witness consumer may use this key to track a stack of function calls. The ``attr.type`` attribute of this key is ``string``. | Yes | Yes |

Tools may introduce their own data nodes with custom keys and values. Other tools should ignore data nodes they do not know or are unable to handle.

This witness specification is a work in progress and will be subject to modifications.


### Additional Edge Data for Concurrent Programs

Validating concurrent programs is a complex task,
because it is necessary to determine possible interleavings of thread operations and when a thread is started or exited.
The following information should additionally be available in the witness:

| key | Meaning | Allowed in Violation Witnesses | Allowed in Correctness Witnesses |
| --- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| threadId | ``threadId`` is used in the analysis of concurrent programs as part of the source-code guard of a transition and represents the currently active thread for the transition. The value of ``data`` elements with this key must uniquely identify an active (i.e., created but not yet destroyed) thread within each run through the automaton, meaning that if two different threads share the same identifier, they must either (a) be on different automaton runs or (b) at each step of each automaton run at most one of them may be active. If a transition has ``data`` elements where one specifies a ``threadId`` and another one uses the ``createThread`` key, the ``threadId`` refers to the thread that creates the new thread, not the created thread. The ``attr.type`` attribute of this key is ``string``. | Yes | Yes |
| createThread | ``createThread`` is used in the analysis of concurrent programs as part of the source-code guard of a transition and restricts the set of CFA edges matched by the source-code guard to operations where a new thread is created. The value of ``data`` elements with this key is an identifier for the new thread. Any string may be used as an identifier, provided that it uniquely identifies an active thread in each automaton run. The initial function of the created thread must be provided in a subsequent automaton transition using the ``enterFunction`` key, except for the main thread of the program, where the same (initial) transition may be used, because at that point, no other thread exists yet. Subsequently, a thread is assumed to be terminated once its callstack is empty again, which is achieved by using a corresponding ``returnFromFunction`` value. The ``attr.type`` attribute of this key is ``string``. | Yes | Yes |

CPAchecker partially supports the validation of violation witnesses for concurrent programs.
This witness specification and the validator are a work in progress and will be subject to modifications.


### Witnessing Program Termination
Termination is a liveness property and, in contrast to safety properties, its violation cannot be witnessed by a finite number of program execution steps.
The witness format proposed so far is designed for witnessing safety properties.
Due to the conceptual differences, some termination witness validators may require additional elements.

The description of the termination witness format required by CPAchecker and how to validate and construct termination witnesses with CPAchecker can be found [here](termination/README.md). Currently, only violation witnesses are supported.

Ultimate Automizer supports termination witnesses as specified by this document. No additional information is necessary. The extensions specified in [the termination witness format required by CPAchecker](termination/README.md) will not lead to rejections, but are currently not used. Ultimate Automizer supports correctness and violation witnesses for termination, although there is currently no way to specify ranking functions.

## Validating Violation Witnesses

Witnesses can be validated by CPAchecker or Ultimate Automizer. To validate a witness, you need to provide the specification the witness was produced with and the witness itself as an additional specification to the tool, as well as any other parameter required by the tool to check the specific type of program, if any.

In the following, we present the violation-witness validation service followed by listing examples of available witness checkers (in alphabetic order).

### Validating Witnesses using a Witness Validation Service

The witness-validation service is designed to be as simple to use as possible. Therefore, you will not need to manually select the specification and architecture the witness was produced for, but may instead include this information within the witness file itself. See the XML ``data`` tags with the keys ``specification`` and ``architecture`` in the [example violation witness](minepump_spec1_product33_false-unreach-call_false-termination.cil.graphml) the assumed [specification](PropertyUnreachCall.prp) and [buggy program](minepump_spec1_product33_false-unreach-call_false-termination.cil.c). Accepted values for the architecture are ``32bit`` (default) and ``64bit``. If you would rather keep the original specification separate, you can still use the witness validators manually, as described further down.
In addition to the [example violation witness](minepump_spec1_product33_false-unreach-call_false-termination.cil.graphml) above, we also provide an [example correctness witness](multivar_true-unreach-call1.graphml) corresponding to a [correct program](multivar_true-unreach-call1.i) for the same [specification](PropertyUnreachCall.prp).

Submit the witness validation job here: [http://vcloud.sosy-lab.org/webclient/runs/witness_validation](http://vcloud.sosy-lab.org/webclient/runs/witness_validation)

Once the job finishes, a result page will appear.

This page provides data like the CPU time, also the log file, a zip file with all output files, and, in case you successfully validated a violation-witness, a link to an error-path report that makes it easy to inspect and understand the confirmed error paths.

This service can also be used via the command line using the following script from CPAchecker: [scripts/witness_validation_web_cloud.py](https://gitlab.com/sosy-lab/software/cpachecker/-/blob/trunk/scripts/witness_validation_web_cloud.py)

<pre>scripts/witness_validation_web_cloud.py --program source.i --witness witness.graphml</pre>

Please note that this script needs some dependencies from [scripts/benchmark](https://gitlab.com/sosy-lab/software/cpachecker/-/tree/trunk/scripts/benchmark)
in order to work properly, so best use it from inside a working CPAchecker copy.

### Validating a Violation Witness with CPAchecker

The following command will start CPAchecker to validate a violation witness for ``test.c``. We assume that the violation witnesses is stored in the file ``witness-to-validate.graphml``.

An easy way to validate violation witnesses with CPAchecker that should be able to handle most scenarios is provided by a predefined configuration:

<pre>./scripts/cpa.sh -witnessValidation \
-witness witness-to-validate.graphml \
-spec PropertyUnreachCall.prp \
test.c
</pre>

There may be cases where you want to use different analyses. It is therefore possible to derive a custom configuration.
Because choosing an analysis yourself requires some basic knowledge of CPAchecker anyway, we assume for this section of the paragraph that you are familiar with CPAchecker's configuration mechanism.

The easiest way to obtain a new witness-validation configuration is by creating a new configuration file.
As an example, we recommend looking at the configuration file for CPAchecker's default witness-validation analysis used above in ``config/witnessValidation.properties`` and the subconfigurations included from there.

Configuring a new witness-validation analysis directly on the command-line prompt is a bit more involved, because you first need to find the ``.spc`` file corresponding to the ``.prp`` specification file you want to use. For ``PropertyUnreachCall.prp``, this would be ``config/specification/sv-comp-reachability.spc``.
The following example shows how to configure CPAchecker to use linear-arithmetic predicate analysis to consume a witness:

<pre>./scripts/cpa.sh -noout -heap 10000M -predicateAnalysis-linear \
-setprop cpa.composite.aggregateBasicBlocks=false \
-setprop cfa.simplifyCfa=false \
-setprop cpa.predicate.ignoreIrrelevantVariables=false \
-setprop counterexample.export.assumptions.assumeLinearArithmetics=true \
-setprop analysis.traversal.byAutomatonVariable=__DISTANCE_TO_VIOLATION \
-setprop cpa.automaton.treatErrorsAsTargets=false \
-setprop WitnessAutomaton.cpa.automaton.treatErrorsAsTargets=true \
-setprop parser.transformTokensToLines=false \
-skipRecursion \
-setprop specification=witness-to-validate.graphml,config/specification/sv-comp-reachability.spc \
test.c
</pre>

For tasks where a 64-bit Linux machine model is assumed, you also need to add the parameter ``-64`` to the command line.

The output of the command should look similar to the following:

<pre>Running CPAchecker with Java heap of size 10000M.
Running CPAchecker with default stack size (1024k). Specify a larger value with -stack if needed.
Using the following resource limits: CPU-time limit of 900s (ResourceLimitChecker.fromConfiguration, INFO)

Verification result: FALSE. Property violation (WitnessAutomaton) found by chosen configuration.
More details about the verification run can be found in the directory "./output".
</pre>

The verification result *"FALSE"* means that the violation witness was successfully validated, i.e., one of the paths that is described by the witness automaton leads to a violation of the specification. The result *"TRUE"* would mean that none of the paths described by the witness automaton lead to a violation of the specification, or in other words, that the witness was rejected. A witness is also rejected if the witness validation does not terminate normally.

### Validating a Violation Witness with Ultimate Automizer
Download a release version of Ultimate Automizer from [Ultimate Automizer's GitHub page](https://github.com/ultimate-pa/ultimate/releases) or a current version from [Ultimate's nightly builds](https://monteverdi.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/ultimate-nightly/).

The following command will start Ultimate Automizer to validate a violation witness for ``test.c``. We assume that the violation witnesses is stored in the file ``witness.graphml``.

<pre>./Ultimate.py \
--architecture 32bit \
--spec PropertyUnreachCall.prp \
--file test.c \
--validate witness.graphml
</pre>
For tasks where a 64-bit Linux machine model is assumed, you also need to use the parameter ``--architecture 64bit`` instead of ``--architecture 32bit``.
You can use the additional parameter ``--full-output`` to get the complete log of the validation run (a complete help is shown with ``--help``).

The output of the command should look similar to the following:

<pre>
$ ./Ultimate.py --architecture 32bit --spec PropertyUnreachCall.prp --file test.c --validate witness.graphml

Calling Ultimate with: /usr/bin/java [...]

Execution finished normally
Writing output log to file Ultimate.log
Writing human readable error path to file UltimateCounterExample.errorpath
Result:
FALSE
</pre>

The verification result *"FALSE"* means that the violation witness was successfully validated, i.e., one of the paths that is described by the witness automaton leads to a violation of the specification. The result *"TRUE"* would mean that none of the paths described by the witness automaton lead to a violation of the specification, in other words, the witness was rejected. A witness is also rejected if the witness validation does not terminate normally.

If you are having trouble using the witness validation, contact the Ultimate team by [creating an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ultimate-pa/ultimate/issues/new).

### Writing a Violation Witness with CPAchecker

In the following example, we assume that the current directory is the CPAchecker directory, ``PropertyUnreachCall.prp`` is the specification that was used to produce the witness, ``witness.graphml`` is the witness file and ``test.c`` is the verification task. The following command shows how to use CPAchecker to verify the task and produce a witness:

<pre>scripts/cpa.sh -noout -heap 10000M -predicateAnalysis \
-setprop cpa.composite.aggregateBasicBlocks=false \
-setprop cfa.simplifyCfa=false \
-setprop cfa.allowBranchSwapping=false \
-setprop cpa.predicate.ignoreIrrelevantVariables=false \
-setprop counterexample.export.assumptions.assumeLinearArithmetics=true \
-setprop counterexample.export.assumptions.includeConstantsForPointers=false \
-setprop counterexample.export.graphml=violation-witness.graphml \
-setprop counterexample.export.compressErrorWitness=false \
-spec PropertyUnreachCall.prp \
test.c
</pre>

For tasks where a 64-bit Linux machine model is assumed, you also need to add the parameter ``-64`` to the command line.

The output of the command should look similar to the following:

<pre>Running CPAchecker with Java heap of size 10000M.
Running CPAchecker with default stack size (1024k). Specify a larger value with -stack if needed.

The violation-witness automaton is written to ``output/witness.graphml``. If the verification is applied an [example program](minepump_spec1_product33_false-unreach-call_false-termination.cil.c) and [specification](PropertyUnreachCall.prp) from the SV-COMP'17 benchmark set, the witness should look similar to [this witness](minepump_spec1_product33_false-unreach-call_false-termination.cil.graphml).

### Writing a Violation Witness with Ultimate Automizer
Similar to validating witnesses, the following command will start Ultimate Automizer to verify a task for which it will come up with a feasible counterexample:

<pre>./Ultimate.py \
--architecture 32bit \
--spec PropertyUnreachCall.prp \
--file test.c
</pre>

You can, as before, change the architecture (``--architecture 64bit``), request the full Ultimate log output (``--full-output``), or show additional options (``--help``).

The violation-witness automaton is written to ``witness.graphml``. If the verification is applied an [example program](minepump_spec1_product33_false-unreach-call_false-termination.cil.c) and [specification](PropertyUnreachCall.prp) from the SV-COMP'17 benchmark set, the witness should look similar to [this witness](minepump_spec1_product33_false-unreach-call_false-termination.cil.ultimateautomizer.graphml).

## Validating Correctness Witnesses

As a running example, we use the verification task [multivar_true-unreach-call1.i](multivar_true-unreach-call1.i) from the SV-COMP'17 benchmark set.

We assume that the program as well as its [specification](PropertyUnreachCall.prp) have been placed in the desired tool's directory.

### Producing Correctness Witnesses with CPAchecker

To produce a witness for the example task with CPAchecker, simply execute the following commands:

<pre>scripts/cpa.sh \
-correctness-witnesses-k-induction \
-spec PropertyUnreachCall.prp \
multivar_true-unreach-call1.i
</pre>

The output of CPAchecker should be similar to the following listing:

<pre>Running CPAchecker with default heap size (1200M). Specify a larger value with -heap if you have more RAM.
Running CPAchecker with default stack size (1024k). Specify a larger value with -stack if needed.
CPAchecker 1.6.1-svn 22870M (Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_101) started (CPAchecker.run, INFO)

The following configuration options were specified but are not used:

Verification result: TRUE. No property violation found by chosen configuration.
More details about the verification run can be found in the directory "./output".
Run scripts/report-generator.py to show graphical report.
</pre>

You will find the correctness witness produced by CPAchecker for the example task 
at ``output/correctness-witness.graphml``.

### Producing Correctness Witnesses with Ultimate Automizer
The procedure for producing a correctness witness with Ultimate Automizer does not differ from producing a violation witness.
To produce a witness for the example task, simply execute the following commands:

<pre>./Ultimate.py \
--spec PropertyUnreachCall.prp \
--file multivar_true-unreach-call1.i \
--architecture 32bit
</pre>

The output of the command should look similar to the following:

<pre>
$ ./Ultimate.py --architecture 32bit --spec PropertyUnreachCall.prp --file multivar_true-unreach-call1.i
Checking for ERROR reachability
Using default analysis
Version 8c2bbc92
Calling Ultimate with: /usr/bin/java [...]
......[...]
Execution finished normally
Writing output log to file Ultimate.log
Result:
TRUE
</pre>

You will find the correctness witness produced by Ultimate Automizer for the example task 
at ``witness.graphml``, which should look similar to [this witness](multivar_true-unreach-call1.ultimateautomizer.graphml).

### Validating Correctness Witnesses with CPAchecker

For the validation, we assume that one of the previously obtained witnesses for the example task has been named ``correctness-witness.graphml`` and placed in the desired tool directory. To validate the correctness witness with CPAchecker, simply execute the following commands:

<pre>scripts/cpa.sh \
-witnessValidation \
    -witness invariantGeneration.kInduction.invariantsAutomatonFile=correctness-witness.graphml \
    -spec PropertyUnreachCall.prp \
    multivar_true-unreach-call1.i
</pre>

If the witness is valid, the output of CPAchecker should end in the following lines:

<pre>Stopping analysis ... (CPAchecker.runAlgorithm, INFO)

Verification result: TRUE. No property violation found by chosen configuration.
More details about the verification run can be found in the directory "./output".
</pre>

Because the CPAchecker-based validator is actually even a correctness-witness testifier, the validation will produce another (usually more abstract) correctness witness 
in ``output/correctness-witness.graphml``.

### Validating Correctness Witnesses with Ultimate Automizer
Again, the procedure for validating a correctness witness with Ultimate Automizer does not differ from validating a violation witness.
For the validation example, we assume that one of the previously obtained witnesses for the example task has been named ``witness.graphml`` and placed in the desired tool directory. To validate the correctness witness with Ultimate Automizer, simply execute the following commands:

<pre>./Ultimate.py \
--spec PropertyUnreachCall.prp \
--file multivar_true-unreach-call1.i \
--architecture 32bit \
--validate witness.graphml
</pre>

A successful validation will result in an output similar to the following:

<pre>
$ ./Ultimate.py --architecture 32bit --spec PropertyUnreachCall.prp --file multivar_true-unreach-call1.i --validate witness.graphml
Checking for ERROR reachability
Using default analysis
Version 8c2bbc92
