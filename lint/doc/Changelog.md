# Witnesslint Changelog

## Version 1.4

Initial release version. Essentially the version used in SV-COMP 2022 with a small number of changes:
 - Added option `excludeRecentChecks` to disable newly introduced checks, e.g. for linting older witnesses.
 - An overview of the checked witness is printed out after linting.
 - Linter output now contains the used linter version.
 - Some bugfixes.
